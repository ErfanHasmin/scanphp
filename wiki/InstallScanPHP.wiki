= Introduction =
If you want a lightweight GUI for your scanner this is your best bet. A very lightweight GUI easily deployed on all your LAN (it's web-based) so it is very easy to acquire scans. Scanning can be easily done also outside the LAN, since any machine which access the web-server can scan - if you have your media at the scanner ;)

  # After you have installed a web server (any web server is good) make sure you install PHP
  # Check if PHP is working fine by putting a file info.php in /var/www (or depends of your OS)
{{{
<?PHP 
         phpinfo();
?>
}}}
  # Install saned on your machine :- For debian based: sudo apt-get install saned
  # Follow details [http://www.sane-project.org/README.linux here] on how to set up SANE
  # Follow details [http://www.sane-project.org/man/saned.1.html here] on how to set up SANEd
  # Check that the configuration is working fine and using sudo do scanimage -L
  # If it works, check that using a non-admin user can do scanimage -L. If the output is different, and says that there is no scanner installed, it means you do not have any right on the scanner
  # Add yourself to the group scanner by doing:
{{{ 
usermod -a -G scanner your_username 
}}}
  # Now you should do *scanimage -L* and have the name of your scanner outputted.
  # Now add your webserver's username (normally _www-data_) to the scanner group
  # Download *sane_x_x.tar.gz* using wget or similar
  # Untar the downloaded file using 
{{{
tar xzvf sane_*_*.tar.gz
}}}
  # Copy the file to a folder readable and writable (/var/www-data for example) by your web server
  # Open the file using your favourite text editor (vi/vim/nano/others) and change the config section to suit your needs
  # Restart your web server
  # Point your web browser to the scan.php file
  # You should have a scanned image asking you to be saved
